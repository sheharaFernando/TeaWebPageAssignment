                                In ancient times we haven't had an Tea plants planted in Sri Lanka.
                                With the arrival of Portugese,British and Dutch people our country had the opportunity to plant "Tea" because of the wide areas wich was suits to plant Tea.
                                Nowadays most of the people used to plant Tea in Sri lanka because of the cooling climate in Nuwara Eliya District and it has become the Sri Lanka's largest export industry for over centuries.
            
                                In 1852 James Tailor arrived to Sri Lanka and he settled down at the Loolecondera Estate which situated in Galaha.He started to plant Tea in the Loolecondera Estate using 19acres from the Estate.
                                In 1867,laying the foundation to the Sri Lanka's largest export industry for over centuries.Then he started a fully equiped factory opened with the development of the technology to operate all the processes in 1872 on the Loolecondera Estate.
                                Twenty-Three pounds of Tea was produced by James Tailor in 1873 making the first international debut to London.

                            <p id="p1"><b>By visiting Loolecondera Estate people werre more interested in planting Tea and Tea planting grew rapidly because of that all over the hill country in 1880s.
                                Coffee plantation had been converted to Tea Planting because Tea Planting become more luctrative alternative.In 1877 the SIROCCO tea dryer and in 1880 the tea rolling machines were developped with the development of the technology.
                                Then the Central Tea Factory was built in 1884 on the FAIRYLAND ESTATE(Pedro) in Nuwaraeliya Sri Lnka.Ceylon Tea was sold at an astonishing price of LKR 36.15 per lb in 1891 at the London Tea auctons.
